# Scala playground

This repository includes some scala related scripts / test projects that don't deserve a repository on its own

## Scala scripts

Bunch of worksheets that I run with [ammonite](https://ammonite.io/) to test out new things.

### How to run

```
amm scala-scripts/src/main/scala/jackson_worksheet/jackson_scala_module_annotations.sc 
```

### How to set it up in Intellij?
